Ditz-gui

Ditz frontend developed using Python and PyQt. Provides fast and
easy access to ditz issues without need to hassle with the
command line tool.

Ditz is a simple, light-weight distributed issue tracker designed
to work with distributed version control systems like git, darcs,
Mercurial, and Bazaar. It can also be used with centralized systems
like SVN. Ditz maintains an issue database directory on disk, with
files written in a line-based and human-editable format. This
directory can be kept under version control, alongside project code.

Tools

Jenkins is used as a continuous integration platform to build
release packages, run PyUnit unit tests and Pylint static code analysis.
And of course, git is used as version control system and tickets, bugs
are tracked using Ditz. As the development progresses the program
itself can be used as the issue tracker.

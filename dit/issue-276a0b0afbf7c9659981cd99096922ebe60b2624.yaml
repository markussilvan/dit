title: Editing issues
desc: |-
  Editing should happen in the main window or in a separate dialog. It's complicated as it starts a separate editor.
  
  EDIT: Can't be done using 'the editor'. Instead yaml files are written directly.

    This comes cheaply along with the implementation to add
    new issues. After adding new issues works perfectly, do
    the editing part.

    Doesn't come as cheaply as a originally hoped.
    Adding became a lot more complex feature
    than the other dit commands.

    Actually it seems fairly easy to do
    with the same dialogs as adding.
    Let do this.

    Preliminary support for this has been
    implemented in issue form and dit-gui.
    Now all is needed is DitzControl to
    actually do the edit.

    Ok, not as simple as expected.
    Editing starts an external editor to edit the yaml
    directly. Thus I must implement a class to read/write
    issue yaml-files to make this work.
    Giving commands to the external editor is not an option.

    First version of reading and writing .yaml is now working.
    Ditz is also able to read those files.

    Editing issues (and thus writing issue .yaml files) is now
    enabled in dit-gui.
    Adding a comment when editing is missing.
    Create a separate issue for that.

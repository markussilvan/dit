  Create a clean base machine for testing.
  It can just be a base Ubuntu image, and
  then provision scripts can try to install
  required libraries from `requirements.txt`.

  This is an easy way to do repeated testing
  with a virgin environment without hardly
  any manual steps.

    A template `Vagrantfile` has been added to `virtual/` folder.
    That doesn't mean that Vagrant would be the chosen way to go.
    Also check how to set up Docker to run Dit.

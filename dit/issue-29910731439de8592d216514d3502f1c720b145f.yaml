  Create a clean base machine for testing.
  It can just be a base Ubuntu image, and
  then provision scripts can try to install
  required libraries from `requirements.txt`.

  This is an easy way to do repeated testing
  with a virgin environment without hardly
  any manual steps.

    A template `Vagrantfile` has been added to `virtual/` folder.
    That doesn't mean that Vagrant would be the chosen way to go.
    Also check how to set up Docker to run Dit.

    Docker would be a much more light-weight solution.
    It's still unclear if it should be used in this way, but
    find it out.

    LXC (Linux Containers) is an another option.
    Currently Docker is anyway the leading option.

  When a release is selected from the main QListWidget,
  then release information could be shown in the main
  QTextEdit. Just like issues.
  This could be implemented in the same way using the
  toHtml() of DitzRelease and a HTML template file.

    Maybe this can be nicely implemented with the help of the DitzIssues' toHtml()
    and html template files.

    This could be the first task to verify that reading of
    release information works.

    Reading of all information in project.yaml is
    now implemented. Next this information needs to
    be made available for the application.
    When releases are read, all information about
    them could be added to those DitzRelease objects
    in the ItemCache. After that then only thing
    left is to modify the toHtml() function and the
    HTML template.

    First version of this completed.
    If the graphical outlook needs changes,
    those can be done later in a separate task.

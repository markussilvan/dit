    This is no longer compatible with original Ditz.
    Hence, rename the whole application. Change datatypes, etc.

    Now, a mass rename has been done.
    Even words in these tickets have been changed.
    For the record, old names were ditz-gui and ditz-cli.
    Now everything should be just 'dit'.

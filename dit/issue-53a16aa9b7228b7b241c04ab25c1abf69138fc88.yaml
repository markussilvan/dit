desc: If issues have been edited simultaneously, conflicts may arise. Then a nice
  colored representation explaining the situation could be shown, and the user could
  be asked to choose one of the changes or to merge manually. This would open an editor
  for the conflicting chunk, and all the git interactions would be done automatically
  afterwards.

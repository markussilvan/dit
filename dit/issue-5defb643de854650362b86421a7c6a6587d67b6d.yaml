  Issue states could be configurable by project.
  If non-default states are used, it will break
  Ditz compatibility. Also note that this should
  be configurable by project, but there is no
  project config file except for project.yaml.

  Try if having custom settings in project config
  will break Ditz compatibility.

  Having this as the only setting in project.yaml
  also seems weird, if other similar settings
  are in application config (as they don't break
  Ditz compatibility).

    Or maybe the real solution is to break
    application config into global and
    local configs and forget about Ditz
    compatibility. Then implementing
    custom (but similar) CLI interface.

    Issue states and issue dispositions have been added
    to application config file.

    A separate task exists for the GUI part. This ticket can be closed.

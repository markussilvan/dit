  Dit should be able to find the project root from any of it's subdirectories.
  Currently, for some reason, it doesn't work from the project root, or
  any deeper level subdirectories, except `dgui` subdirectory.
  In other directories it just prints a list of releases, but can't read any issues.
  Why is that?

    This is important as dit-cli might not work at all
    for other projects than Dit itself with this issue.

    This might be regression or only related to dit-cli.

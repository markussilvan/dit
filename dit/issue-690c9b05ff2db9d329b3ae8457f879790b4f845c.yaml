  Try adding new issue states. See if Ditz command line can handle it. If so, add "blocked" as a new issue state.

  These should be made configurable (per project), but
  that is a separate task.

    Added "blocked" to config.
    Is that all that is needed?

    Original Ditz commandline breaks if other issue states are
    used. This feature can't be implemented.
    Or it can be made configurable, but it must be made clear
    that it breaks Ditz compatibility.

    'Blocked' state removed from config. I won't use
    incompatible states for now. But this still should
    be made configurable, just like all the other similar
    features.

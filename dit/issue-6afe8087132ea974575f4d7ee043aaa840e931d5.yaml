title: Git commit hooks
desc: |-
  A git commit hook to close issues fixed in a commit
  would be very nice. If possible, the hook could also
  add the changed dit issue to the commit.
  If dit issues are in a separate branch, the hook
  could make the change there.
  
  This is quite a complicated hook. Sounds more like
  a pre-commit hook, or a combination of multiple hooks.
  
  An example of a similar hook implementation can be found
  from git<->trac commit hook implementation which
  closes the related Trac issues.
  
  Also think about the possible security implications
  of this implementation. The hooks require www-data
  access rights in this case, and that could be a problem.
  Could that be avoided somehow? Or is it worth it to waste
  time on that at this point?

    The git<->trac commit hook is also described in NitroWiki.
    Check there for explanation on how it works.

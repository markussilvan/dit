title: Stopping work on an issue
desc: |-
  Just like starting work on an issue, there needs to be a way
  to stop working. The main view with the list of issue is the right
  place to do this.
  
  1. Select issue from a list
  2. Select Stop working from the context-menu, pull-down menu
     or a button
  3. Dialog to verify? I don't think it's needed or should
     be configurable.

  - changed status from unstarted to in_progress
  - If starting work on an issue now works from the UI, then next thing to implement is stopping working.

    Ok. Starting works. And canceling works.
    Stopping works. And cancelling (in the dialog view) works.

    Stopping work again. As it's probably completed :)
    Starting/stopping should be working smoothly now.
    Even when canceling or changing selections or anything.

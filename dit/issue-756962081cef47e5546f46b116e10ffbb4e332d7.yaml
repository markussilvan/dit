title: Adding a comment when editing issues
desc: |-
  There should be a fixed comment to inform that issue was edited. Ditz does this, the GUI
  should too.
  
  Also a possibility to give an optional comment using CommentDialog would be nice. And pretty easy to implement.
  
  EDIT: it should work now.

    Some other "commands" would also need
    these automatic comments. More specifically
    all commands implemented without Ditz
    interaction need this.

    DitzControl now contains implementation to support this.
    Some changes in GUI or other parts of DitzControl may still
    be needed. Lets see.

    Yes, indeed, it works.
    Same mechanism should be used with all commands,
    that don't use Ditz command line.

    Done for both "custom" commands now.
    All commands that don't use Ditz commandline need to do
    this, so remember to add it to all new commands, too.

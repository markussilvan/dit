title: Support for components
desc: |-
  Ditz also supports components. Issues can be added to different components.
  This is a feature that can be added later and it can mostly be copied
  from the code used for making releases.

    Comment field added to DitzItem. Its also used by YamlIssueObject.
    So component information is read from files and stored, but
    it's not used anywhere else. Support for components is
    to be added later.

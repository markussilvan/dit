  Currently icons from actions don't
  show up in the context menu.
  This might be happening just because of
  some property on QMenu or QAction.

  Search online for a possible solution and
  go through all properties on these two
  classes. Also check if context menu requires
  different size of images or something else.

    "So changing ALL the places where i use a QAction solved the problem."
    "It was about iconVisibleInMenu" property."
                     - Internet

    Try this, see if it helps.

    This is on pause while I figure out the releases.
    And test all possibilities.

    The context menu actions are not the same actions.
    Most of the actions are custom versions created to
    get a custom label for the popup.
    It would be better to use the same actions for everything.
    Then these icons might even work.

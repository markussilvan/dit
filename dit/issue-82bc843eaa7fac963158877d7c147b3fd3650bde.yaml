title: Assigning issues when release is renamed

  If release is renamed, then issues should be assigned
  to that release, or set as unassigned. Ask the user what
  should be done.
  If issues are assigned to an unknown release, they are not
  shown on the UI.

    Ditz commandline won't allow making a release
    if it contains open issues. This could be a reason
    why Ditz doesn't support renaming of releases.

    Issues are now assigned to the renamed release.
    A comment is automatically added to each release.
    Maybe a confirmation dialog should be added?

  Dialog should be big enough, so it won't
  create scrollbars when identifiers are added as
  references. Of course, if links to issues could be
  added, then this would be redundant.

    Default size is now changed so it fits
    identifiers in the references field nicely.
    Still looks like a nice dialog like before.

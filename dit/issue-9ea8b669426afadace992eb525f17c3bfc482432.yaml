  This is just refactoring, but might clean up the
  code a bit.
  Instead of making all requests with issue names
  DitzGui could use identifiers instead now that it
  knows them due the cached items.

    DitzGui can't know the identifiers, it only knows
    the information shown on the screen.
    And making it configurable doesn't make sense at this point.
    Issue names are changed to identifiers as the first thing
    on the DitzControl side. So I guess this is ok as is.

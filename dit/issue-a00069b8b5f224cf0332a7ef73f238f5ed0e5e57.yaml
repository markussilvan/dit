title: Supporting timezone in "ago"
desc: |-
  Currently human_time_diff() disregards
  any timezone information.
  All times are stored in UTC.
  Thus all "ago" style fields are shown
  2 hours too much in the past.

    human_time_diff() is now changed to always
    use UTC times. Also times given as
    parameters are assumed to be in UTC.

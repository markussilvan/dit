title: DitzItem <-> IssueYamlObject type conversions
desc: |-
  Editing issues requires these type conversions
  for convenience. Reading and writing .yaml files
  can be then encapsulated more effectively.

    This is mostly done, but there are some inconsistencies.
      - Component is missing from DitzItem
      - Creation_time is missing from DitzItem (uses "ago" string instead)
      - Order of items is different, but this doesn't matter, at least for now
      - References should stored as list of strings(?)
    
    Could I even go as far as using some sort of derived type of IssueYamlObject?
    Turning DitzItem into a hierarchy of objects? Releases could have their own
    ReleaseYamlObject?
    
    Think and try different solutions.

    Custom implementation for showing textual time
    differences done. Now use it to show "ago".

    Also component has been added to DitzItem. It's only printed to output
    if it has been set.

    Think this can be closed.
    The issue with multiple references is handled in a separate ticket.

title: Split DitzReader
desc: |-
  Separate Ditz config file reading from
  project.yaml reading. Those two
  need their separate classes and
  maybe even those metaclasses to handle
  reading and writing of files.
  Actual control classes are then separate,
  which can be then combined by a master
  config control? Think about this after
  the reader classes have been implemented.

    Done as part of implementing application specific
    configuration file handling.
    Still not sure this is the right way to go, but works.

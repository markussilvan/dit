title: Support bucket tickets
desc: |-
  Tickets should be able to contain other tickets.
  By that I mean tasks containing subtasks.
  
  Simplest solution is to add a parent field in each
  ticket containing a hash of the parent ticket.
  However, that is not very efficient solution.
  Sorting tickets to directories would be better.
  
  Think about pros and cons of different solutions.
  Implement something to get this, as it is a very
  useful feature. Currently only releases can be
  used for this.

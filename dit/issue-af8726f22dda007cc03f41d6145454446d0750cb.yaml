title: A setting in config for default issue type
desc: |-
  When adding issues "bugfix" is selected by default.
  It should be configurable. There should be a
  combobox in setting, where you can select this.
  Then its saved in config file and read to ConfigControl.
  IssueDialog can set the combobox index according to information it gets from ConfigControl.

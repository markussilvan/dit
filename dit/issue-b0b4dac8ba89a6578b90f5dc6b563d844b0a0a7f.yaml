title: Text alignment in list of Ditz items
desc: |-
  The list of Ditz items in listWidgetDitzItems is now fine
  except for one detail. When the dit_name/dit_id field
  length changes, the headers of those items are not
  aligned. This happens if there are multiple components
  or if more digits are added to dit names.
  For example "{issue cd68c54f4f3a215ec7eee0828c19d32719a86616}" vs. "{issue cbff37e95538779ff3dc05e883a62e7627a1a121}".
  
  If the listWidget doesn't provide a way to align those
  fields, I could derive my own, set the texts with
  padding or using tableWidget instead.
  Changing to tableWidget might be a big hassle, so
  padding options should be considered first as a
  quick fix.

    I have aligned the fields using a monospaced font
    and aligning text that is printed to the list items rows.
    That is a good enough solution. QTableWidget can be
    considered is there is proven life with the Ditz project.

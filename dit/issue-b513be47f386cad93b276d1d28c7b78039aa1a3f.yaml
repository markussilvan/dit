title: Reimplement DitzControl.get_items() to use IssueCache
desc: |-
  Instead of using "dit todo" I want to do the same
  functionality using the IssueCache and some sort of cache
  of existing releases. Or maybe those don't need to be cached
  and get_releases() is enough for it. At least for now.
  
  Other option is to extend IssueCache to a complete ItemCache
  which also holds a cache of releases read from yaml files.
  Actually this might be quite simple to implement.
  
  Replace any use of DitzControl.dit_items "items cache" with
  the new ItemCache or functionality built around it.

    These same test scripts could be used to implement
    console interface for DitzControl (and thus to
    the whole software).
    That would be only useful is this becomes uncompatible
    with Ditz and/or Ditz project completely dies and
    becomes unavailable.

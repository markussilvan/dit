  Changing item selection with mouse button pressed
  works strangely. The second last selection is left active
  and the last selection is not loaded to the QTextEdit.

  If Drag'n'Drop is enabled at some point, it will hide this
  issue also.

  Maybe this could be easily fixed by setting some signal
  from the listview to just show the item.
  If this solution is found quickly, it worth doing it
  temporarily, even if Drag'n'Drop is enabled later.

  If Ditz is used like I am used to using it. Then one good
  feature would be to add changes to git index automatically.
  User doesn't want to do that manually when using a GUI.

  Or there could be a toolbar button to "upload" changes to git.
  That would stash other changes, add and commit all dit items,
  then pop changes back. But that is an another issue and a
  different mode of using the software.

    run_interactive_command() could be resurrected for this.
    Git command line is designed to work also from an
    external porcelain layer.

  There should be a tab on settings dialog
  to handle issue types and dispositions
  used on the current project.
  Lists, which are read from and written to
  application settings, should be now
  configated using some sort of graphical
  list QListView or QTableView?

  Add and remove is enough for now, but
  keep in mind, that color could be one
  option that can be configured for each
  issue state. There is already a separate
  task for that.

    Issue states and dispositions are already stored in
    application config file. A view to change those settings
    is just missing.

    DitzItem objects containing issues are only
    created in one place. It makes this change
    simple. Releases are created in couple of
    places, but that is still quite manageable.

    If this change is needed, then it should be
    done now.

    Ok, lets see how this works out.
    If it doens't, just throw the implementation away.

    Ok. This has been done.
    It helped to notice some other refactorings
    that were nice to do.

    Lets see if everything still works. Then
    push the change. This is better than before.

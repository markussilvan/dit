  A view that shows a list of releases is needed for assigning issues
  to a release, viewing releases and removing releases.

    This could also include a feature to change release ordering.
    It would change order of releases in project.yaml file.
    (And thus in the main view.)

    I am not sure if this is even needed.
    All these things can be also done from the
    main QListWidget as it already lists
    all releases.

    This is not needed. Releases can be handled the same
    way as issues. A separate dialog for editing a release is
    needed, but that is different than this.

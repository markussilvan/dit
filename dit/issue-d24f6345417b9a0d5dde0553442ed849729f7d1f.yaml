  Try if new issue dispositions work with original
  Ditz command line tool. If it does, then try
  adding some new disposition, for example,
  "invalid".

  These should be also made configurable from
  the settings file, but that could be done in a
  separate ticket.

    List of dispositions is hardcoded in config.
    Ditz commandline most likely doesn't care about
    disposition as it doesn't even show closed issues.
    Lets see if everything else works.

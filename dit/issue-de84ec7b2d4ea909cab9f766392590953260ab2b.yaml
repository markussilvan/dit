  To drop Ditz dependency completely, implement
  custom command line interface. It should be
  similar to what dit has.
  Implementation should be fairly easy, and
  stuff from playground can be used to get
  started.

    Then the system can be renamed to tIssue, if
    there is no Ditz dependence or compatibility
    anymore.

    This would greatly improve tool's usability.
    Now that the tool is not completely (backwards) compatible with original Ditz anymore, this has become more important.

  - Text UI would also work as a tool for testing new features being developed.

  - status changed from unstarted to in progress
  - |-
    Many basic features have been implemented.
    Adding new ones is fairly easy.
    Calling same core library as dit-gui does is simple without many complications.

    Now also commenting an issue has been implemented.
    Asking for a comment has been also added as part of many other commands.

    Soon, this issue could be closed, and separate tickets created for features
    still missing from the CLI interface.
    Currently the plan is not to add some release handling related functionality
    to the CLI at all. And first just finish and even polish all issue related
    features.

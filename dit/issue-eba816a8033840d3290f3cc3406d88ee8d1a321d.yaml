title: Convert all unit tests to use testlib
desc: |-
  Using a common "testlib" is a better approach
  for writing many similar unit tests.
  Use the common library in all unit tests.
  This only provides extra functionality without

    That was even faster than expected.
    In the future all testlib can be improved further
    to make it a complete test runner.

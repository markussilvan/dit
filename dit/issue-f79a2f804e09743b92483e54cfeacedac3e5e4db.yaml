  In a long list of issues, or issues with bad topics, there rises
  the need to be able to seach the issues based on topic, description or
  comments. Grep is supported by the command line tool, so this should
  be implemented in the UI too.

    There could be a search box on the tool bar which
    affects what items are shown on the main list view.

    This could be implemented also as a search box on top the list view.
    Then list view would updated accordingly with help from
    "dit grep". All functions to DitzControl should still work
    as they refer to items with names or identifiers, and never
    use list indices or anything UI specific.

    Searches are easier to implement now
    with ItemCache than with Ditz or .yaml
    files directly.

  - Even a simple search to for words from topics would be useful.

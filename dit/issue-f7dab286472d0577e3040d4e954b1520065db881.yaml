title: Make Ditz windows remember their size
desc: |-
  Users have different preferences and different sizes of displays and fonts.
  Ditz-gui windows should also adapt to that. As they do.
  But the windows should also remember their size, so user doesn't always
  need to adjust it when starting dit-gui.

    Which other windows need to be able to remember their size?
    It may not be feasible to do this for all windows and
    layout of some dialogs might look silly if this is done
    for all dialog windows.

    ConfigControl needs to implement writing the settings
    to .ditconfig from a given dictionary.
    This can be done easily using python-yaml.

    ConfigControl now supports writing .dit-config.
    Integration to IssueDialog is the only missing part.

    This should be ok now except for settings "settings_changed" flag
    whenever settings have been modified on the settings dialog.
    Settings dialog needs an action which does this, and that
    action needs to be triggered from any input fields "modied" signal
    (or equivalent).

    These settings are there and working.
    More settings should be added later.
    At least UI and git should have their own tabs.
    That is another task. This issue can be considered done.

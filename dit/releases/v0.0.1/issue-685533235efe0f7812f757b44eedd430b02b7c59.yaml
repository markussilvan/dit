title: Remove scrollArea from main window
desc: |-
  The QScrollArea on main window is useless.
  Remove it when you have a clean table, so it's easy to test that it
  doesn't break anything.

    Lets see how I can make the UI look better.
    I'll also take a look at adding a toolbar.

    ScrollArea removed. That was easy.
    Modifying the UI seems to be quite easy and
    writing code for it doesn't tie it down too much.

    Ok, now also a Toolbar is added and the ScrollArea was
    already removed earlier. Looks nice. Functinality for the
    toolbar needs to be implemented. I'll create a task for that.

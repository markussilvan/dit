title: Select a GUI framework
desc: |-
  The idea in my mind now is Python + PyQt.
  That would make the project much easier to implement.
  It would be also easier to experiment with different user interface
  designs.
  
  Later I can write the whole thing again in C++ if there is a good reason
  for it.

    Other option would be to write this in C++ and use Qt or GTK.
    But I am inclined to try the Python + PyQt solution first.
    Requires less tools and makes starting the project easier.

    Seems I am trying first with Python + PyQt.
    Lets see if I can even manage to do the main view with it.
    It least development should be fast.

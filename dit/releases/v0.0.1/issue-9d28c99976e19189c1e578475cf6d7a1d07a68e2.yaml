title: Implement actions for menus
desc: |-
  Implement actions for the common menu options.
  Quit is the first example to test how it works along with Qt Creator.
  Reload is good for testing how DitzControl is coming along.
  It can be the first place to test reading dit data to the UI.

    Adding some actions early will show how code and Qt Creator .ui files
    work together.

  - Just do this from the code as it seems impossible to do from Qt Creator.

    This has been done in code. You can still play around to see
    if this can be done in UI too. Also if same actions are lauched
    from multiple locations, then connect those actions together
    using the UI.

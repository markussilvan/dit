    Currently will show all releases, also the released ones.
    An option to only show unreleased releases is needed.

    If Ditz can't reliably order releases then, optional ordering
    for release names could be used here too.

    A yaml reading solution for this exists.
    Maybe I should use that, just for kicks.
    Dependency to python-yaml will come
    eventually anyway.

    Yaml solution is now used. And other dependies for
    python-yaml have already shown up.
    
    get_releases() in DitzControl needs to be commented clearly.
    These two functionalities should not be mixed unintentionally.

    Unreleases are always in the order of .yaml file content.
    Regardless of the method used to read the data.
    This can be considered a non-issue.
    
    Problems arise when an issue needs to be assigned
    from one release to another. Then the ordering
    changes. Still that can be calculated.

title: Commenting issues
desc: |-
  One of the main issues is commenting issues.
  The main view needs to have an easy way to add a comment for an issue.
  Seeing the issue and its comments before commenting would be nice.

    Comment dialog UI has already been created in Qt Creator.
    Try to show it, modal, and get the comment text, or cancellation.
    Then figure out how to get that back into dit.
    It will require some interaction with Ditz

    Ok. Commenting issues from dit-gui seems
    to be working nicely. I thing to think about is
    the text wrapping. Now I am doing it "manually",
    but it should be automatic on the comment box.

    This is what it looks like if I just write everything on one line and let the GUI take care of wrapping. The text itself doesn't contain any newlines. I hope this is still automatically cut into lines. It would make my day.
    
    Cutting the text into lines is not a big task if I still need to do it.

    Actually there should be a global setting for text wrapping.
    The same issue exists in many places. Some users might want to wrap
    and some don't. I would prefer wrapping.

    Still works.
    Now lets see if closing an issue from dit-gui works.

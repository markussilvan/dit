  Obviously it needs to be possible to close completed tasks.
  Select task and from the menu, choose close.
  No further explanation needed.
  
  Then a comment dialog to give a comment? Not mandatory.

    A "prototype" of this is already working. Now do it nicely with
    a separate dialog or at least with a contextmenu submenu, which can
    set disposition.

    Seems to work nicely.
    Closing issues with a "sub-contextmenu" has been split
    to a separate task.

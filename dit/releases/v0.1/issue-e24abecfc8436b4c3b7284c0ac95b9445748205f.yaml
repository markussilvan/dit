    Some formatting like colored text, bold, italics could be used to
    show if task has changes, if it's assigned to you or something
    like that.

    Some implementation to add icons has been added.
    I expect it will look nice with the right graphics.

    After severe refactoring, the view now looks a bit better.
    Ditz items are now stored as DitzItem objects in a list.
    Type, status, etc can be asked easily from DitzControl.

    Now, using monospaced font, the list is also aligned.
    Too bad the monospaced fonts don't look as good as
    the default font. (Of course that could be different
    for different users too.)
    
    Font should be configurable from settings.

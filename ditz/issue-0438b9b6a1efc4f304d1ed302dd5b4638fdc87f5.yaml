title: Support for specifying path on command line
desc: |-
  Path to Ditz location should be definable.
  Python subprocess.Popen() takes cwd argument to specify
  working directory. This could be an easy way to change
  where ditz commands are being run regardless where
  the software was started.
  
  Also think about starting the sorftware from a link.
  Then "opening" ditz location using Ditz->Open from
  the menus.

desc: |-

  can be dragged from release to another, but that may not be possible
  to implement.

    This is what assigning looks like:
    mape@nitro:~/workarea/ditz-gui/src$ ditz assign {issue 04c6097b9b3f5060a20a00a46af0040733c0eba0}
    Issue {issue 04c6097b9b3f5060a20a00a46af0040733c0eba0} currently assigned to release v0.2.
    Choose a release:
      1) v0.5 (unreleased)
      2) v0.4 (unreleased)
      3) v0.1.1 (unreleased)
      4) v0.1.2 (unreleased)
      5) v0.3 (unreleased)
      6) v0.0.1 (released 2014-10-11)
      7) v0.1 (released 2014-10-18)
    Release (1--7): 3
    Comments (ctrl-d, ., or /stop to stop, /edit to edit, /reset to reset):
    >
    Assigned {issue 04c6097b9b3f5060a20a00a46af0040733c0eba0} to v0.1.1.
    You may have to inform your SCM that the following files have been modified:
      ../ditz/issue-04c6097b9b3f5060a20a00a46af0040733c0eba0.yaml

    This task could be used as the first test
    to read and write ditz issues from yaml
    in real environment.
    Implementing this feature by others means
    is not rally feasible at this point.

    DitzControl now supports assigning issues to a release.
    Adding comments while doing that is not yet supported.
    As YAML writing is still disabled, this feature is not
    in use.
    GUI portion needed to implement this is also still missing.

    Now that editing works (and assigning can be done with
    edits by the way), this could be implemented.
    Some implementation needed in the GUI for this.
    Create an assign-dialog.

    More testing made with assigning
    (as can be seen in the history of this task).
    Some sketching for the implementation of the
    GUI part of this task.
    
    That still needs to be finished and tested.

title: Rename YamlControl to IssueModel
desc: |-
  A common naming scheme should be used
  everywhere in the codebase.
  Thus all components touching .yaml files
  (or other datastores?) should be named
  Models.
  Rename yamlcontrol.py as issuemodel.py or
  issue[something].py and rename all classes
  within to use the common naming scheme.

    This should be quite a small task on a small
    piece of code that doesn't affect functionality
    of the software at all.

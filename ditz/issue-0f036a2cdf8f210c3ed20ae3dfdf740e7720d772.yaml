title: Debian packaging for the project
desc: |-
  If this project ever makes it to be a finished application, it must be
  packaged as a Debian package to be easily installable. Then I could even
  get it to be as a part of Debian and Ubuntu and become a package maintainer.

    This should be quite easy to do with instructions
    found online.
    And I have done this before.

    I have made a skeleton files for new Debian
    packages before. Just try to find them :)

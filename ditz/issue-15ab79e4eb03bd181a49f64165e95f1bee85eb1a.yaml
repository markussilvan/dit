title: Using listview with keyboard
desc: |-
  Currently listview selection is not updated when
  highlighted item is changed using keyboard. Using keyboard must be possible as power users want
  to do that anyway. Especially on Linux. This
  should be easy to fix.

    This shoudn't need anything more than connecting
    some existing signals to slots and maybe setting
    some new shortcuts for actions.

    Ok. Moving up/down now works as expected.
    Maybe shortcuts like E for edit, C for commenting, etc
    should be added.

    Several simple keyboard shortcuts have now been added.
    Lets see how that works.

    Change the issue textedit to be non-editable.
    Change TAB to change back to list view, if this can be
    done easily.
    
    Same functionality for TAB would be preferable in other
    text boxes too, for example, the CommentDialog.

    Ok. Now it's done for the main text edit and
    the comment dialog. That was easy.
    I'll check out other dialogs too. IssueDialog
    might benefit from the same behaviour.

    IssueDialog already does that.
    What is focus is completely lost in the main window?
    This happens at startup, and when closing other dialogs.

    Good enough. Add more shortcuts later.
    Change the shortcuts to use a modifier key (CTRL?), if
    problems arise from unintentional actions.

    Also, I changed the same "tabChangesFocus" property to
    CloseDialog. Now all seems good.

title: Convert Ditz cmdline commands to custom commands
desc: |-
  Some commands could be easily converted to custom commands.
  Do this when there is no motivation to do anything else.
  Commands to convert:
   - add issue
   - comment
   - start work
   - stop work
   - close issue
   - drop issue
  
  Edit issue and assign issue are already converted. Use those
  as reference. Add proper error handling.

title: Convert Ditz cmdline commands to custom commands
desc: |-
  Some commands could be easily converted to custom commands.
  Do this when there is no motivation to do anything else.
  Commands to convert:
   - add issue
   - comment
   - start work
   - stop work
   - close issue
   - drop issue
  
  Edit issue and assign issue are already converted. Use those
  as reference. Add proper error handling.

    Implementations for start work, stop work
    and close issue done.
    I knew it was easy, but went easier than expected.
    Test all functions and commit.
    Convert the other functions, too.

    Now also "comment" command is reimplemented.
    Add_issue() and maybe something else still
    should be converted.

    Release related command will need this too,
    a separate ticket can be made for those.
    
    Before DitzControl._run_command() and
    DitzControl._run_interactive_command() is
    removed, copy those to a library and make
    examples.

  Use a generic file dialog to ask for a path where
  to archive a release. If this is not possible for
  some reason, then use a custom ArchiveDialog instead.
  This would also allow asking for other data, if needed
  in the future.

    For now using a stadard file dialog should be enough.
    I see no reason to overcomplicate things at this point.

    Could this be limited to select a subdirectory of your ditz_dir?
    That MIGHT make sense.

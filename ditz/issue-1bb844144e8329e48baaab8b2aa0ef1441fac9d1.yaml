  Use a generic file dialog to ask for a path where
  to archive a release. If this is not possible for
  some reason, then use a custom ArchiveDialog instead.
  This would also allow asking for other data, if needed
  in the future.

    For now using a stadard file dialog should be enough.
    I see no reason to overcomplicate things at this point.

    Could this be limited to select a subdirectory of your ditz_dir?
    That MIGHT make sense.

    Blocked by other tasks. Old releases can't be archived
    as they are not visible in the list. There is no setting
    to set them visible (although system mostly supports it).

title: Text formatting of issue type
desc: |-
  When issue type is read or written to YAML.
  It should be noted that ':' is read as the first

  same behaviour. This can be fixed in
  IssueYAMLControl.

    This would be also good point to provide a separate
    method for formatted output containing HTML or
    whatever is needed for QTextEdit.

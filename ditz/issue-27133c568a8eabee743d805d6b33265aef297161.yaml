  This setting is already read and written to settings file.
  It should be also used on the settings dialog.
  At least IssueDialog is not showing the configured value
  by default when adding a new issue, so something is still
  missing.

    This should be quick and easy, so there is no reason
    not to do this out of the way.

    Superficially it looks like everything is ok
    and the settings is used. Maybe the code
    loading it to the form is doing something
    wrong.
    Anyway this must be checked with access to the UI
    and not over the terminal :)

    Ok, done. The setting was used everywhere on
    SettingsDialog, but it wasn't used in IssueDialog.
    Now it is.

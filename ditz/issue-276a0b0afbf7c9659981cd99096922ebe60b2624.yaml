desc: Editing should happen in the main window or in a separate dialog. It's complicated as it starts a separate editor.

    This comes cheaply along with the implementation to add
    new issues. After adding new issues works perfectly, do
    the editing part.

    Doesn't come as cheaply as a originally hoped.
    Adding became a lot more complex feature
    than the other ditz commands.

    Actually it seems fairly easy to do
    with the same dialogs as adding.
    Let do this.

    Preliminary support for this has been
    implemented in issue form and ditz-gui.
    Now all is needed is DitzControl to
    actually do the edit.

    Ok, not as simple as expected.
    Editing starts an external editor to edit the yaml
    directly. Thus I must implement a class to read/write
    issue yaml-files to make this work.
    Giving commands to the external editor is not an option.

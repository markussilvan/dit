title: Reading and writing issue to YAML
desc: |-
  Reading and writing issue files.
  This should be compatible with Ditz,
  at least for now.
  
  Most of this has been implemented already.
  Some inconsistencies between existing DitzItem
  and the .yaml representation of issues.
  For example, creation_time.
  Fix these and try to get editing issue to
  work using these facilities.

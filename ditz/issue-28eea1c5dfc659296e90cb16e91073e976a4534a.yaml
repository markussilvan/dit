title: Reading and writing issue to YAML
desc: |-
  Reading and writing issue files.
  This should be compatible with Ditz,
  at least for now.
  
  Most of this has been implemented already.
  Some inconsistencies between existing DitzItem
  and the .yaml representation of issues.
  For example, creation_time.
  Fix these and try to get editing issue to
  work using these facilities.

    Reading from .yaml to GUI now works, but it's quite a hack.
    Also formatting of log entries is missing. This would need to be
    added to DitzItem, as log is not just a string, but a complete
    structure.

    Formatting of log entries has been added.
    Now a way to read all items (at least basic information) and cache that is needed.
    Then the "issue names" can be generated by the software.
    
    Or is it enough to list all files by creation date/time and
    assign names based on that order?
    Or is it more reliable to list the hashes, and use that order?
    Try to figure out (or read the source to see) how Ditz does it.
    
    When this cache of items is created, all other operations are
    easier and faster.

    A separate ticket for caching exists. This ticket can be closed.
    Reading .yaml works perfectly. Writing works, except the ordering of
    fields in the file changes compared to Ditz. But that is not a problem
    at this point. It can be fixed later, in one class, if needed.

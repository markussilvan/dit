title: Support for Ditz plugings
desc: |-
  Ditz plugins may alter the output of Ditz commands.
  In these cases Ditz should have a good parser to go through
  the data or preferably it should be able to read .yaml files
  directly.
  Even if everything else is done via Ditz commands, reading
  information for a complete Ditz issue could be done
  with a yaml-parser from the file directly.
  Possibly new data fields, for example priority, could
  be supported even when using Ditz command line output,
  if the output parser is good enough.

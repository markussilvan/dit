  If an issue is not assigned to a release, it's not shown
  in the list of issues. This happens because the issue is file
  has 'release' set to 'Unassigned'. Really that field
  should be left empty if the issue is not assigned to
  a release.

  An easy fix, but has to be tested with Ditz commandline
  and ditz-gui.

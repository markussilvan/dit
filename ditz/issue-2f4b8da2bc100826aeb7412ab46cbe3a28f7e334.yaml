title: Creating a nicely formatted todo list
desc: |-
  The command line tool can create a todo list.
  The GUI should be able to create a list that is more beautiful.
  At first, the list generated by the command line is enough, but
  later some formatting, different output options or even templates
  could be added.

    The todo command is actually "the default command" of Ditz without
    any parameters. Of course I can use that to format a more beautiful
    todo list, but that is low priority.

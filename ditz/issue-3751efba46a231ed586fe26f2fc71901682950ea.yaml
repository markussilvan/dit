  Try and see what happens if a new issue type is added.
  "Enhancement" is one such option.
  Ditz-gui should be able to cope with it (or it's a bug).
  Config is the only place that requires changes (and
  that is only to provide a list of allowed values).

  Then see if Ditz still works. If Ditz remain fully functional,
  add new configuration variable (a list), for custom issue
  types in .ditz-gui-config.

    I tried changing this ticket manually to 'enhancement'.
    Seems to work with command line ditz just fine.
    Now add a configuration setting for issue types.
    Make sure all parts of the software work with it.

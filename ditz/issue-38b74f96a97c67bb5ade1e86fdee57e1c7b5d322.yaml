title: HTML formatting in issue textedit
desc: |-
  When browsing issue, it would be nice is some
  fields would be hightlighted.
  Colors and bold/italics also make the GUI look nice.
  
  Adding DitzItems as HTML should be possible
  with setPlainText(), appendPlainText() and the
  corresponding HTML versions.
  
  Try how they work. If it works easily, then
  add an option to DitzItem.__str__() or create toHTML() method to do some HTML formatting
  for issue output.

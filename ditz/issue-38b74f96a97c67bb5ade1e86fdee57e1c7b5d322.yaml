  When browsing issue, it would be nice is some
  fields would be hightlighted.
  Colors and bold/italics also make the GUI look nice.

  Adding DitzItems as HTML should be possible
  with setPlainText(), appendPlainText() and the
  corresponding HTML versions.

  Try how they work. If it works easily, then
  add an option to DitzItem.__str__() or create toHTML() method to do some HTML formatting
  for issue output.

    The GUI looks pretty good. I think this is the weak
    link in the GUI currently. Should be fixed.

    Lets see how this works out.
    Could be an easy way to improve the UI.

    Ok. HTML formatting works nicely.
    Now do a proper HTML-template for
    issues (and releases) that can be then used
    to write a nice implementation for
    toHtml()-functions in common/items.py.

    HTML formatting is working. A template is used so code
    doesn't necessarily need changes if layout is changed.
    More beautiful layout (with graphics?) should be done later,
    but that is a separate issue.

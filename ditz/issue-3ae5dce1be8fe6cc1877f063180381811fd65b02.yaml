title: Adding references directly from Issue dialog
desc: |-
  Normally a references can't be added when
  creating a Ditz issue.
  Support at least adding one reference as it is very easy to implement.
  Support for multiple reference would require
  changes to the UI dialog, and those can be made
  later if there is interest.

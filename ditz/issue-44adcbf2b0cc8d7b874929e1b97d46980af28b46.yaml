title: Commenting a release
desc: |-
  Releases have the same comment system as issues.
  So why not add a mechanism to comment releases.
  This is a common feature in bigger systems.

    Commenting works when releases are added or edited.
    A command for just commenting a release is still needed.

    An ugly icon for commenting has been added already.
    Create an action for it to see what it really looks like.
    Implement commenting using a testing script first?

    This was easy.
    Can be refactored later to have the beef inside config
    instead of doing any extra stuff in the UI code.

title: Add git commit template
desc: |-
  Commit template can be added using prepape-commit-msg git hook.
  This has been already tested on mlib, so it's easy to add here too.
  
  Editing the message template is just editing a text file, so it's easy.
  Later the file can changed if other more interesting fields are
  to be included in commit messages.

    Done. It was easy to copy from the other project.
    Current implementation only works on bash, but it doesn't matter.

title: Draw colorful icons for list items
desc: |-
  List items need small (16x16 pixels) icons to show their state.
  The current blue icon set can be used as a base. But change their colors.
  Have the icons in separate files, item_icon_xxx.png to signify
  for what they are used.

    All the icons need to be big round balls, or I need a
    different set of thin icons. The thin icon for new item looked good, so I could try making such icons for all types of items.

    Done. Better graphics can be made later.
    Preferably couple of different sets of icons that
    can be changed from settings even.

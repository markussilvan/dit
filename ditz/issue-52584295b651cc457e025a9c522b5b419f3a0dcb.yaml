title: Adding a reference to an another issue
desc: |-
  This should be easy, or even automated, when certain strings appear in
  description or comments of the issue.
  Of course the simple way to implement this is just to add a menu option
  to "add reference" which shows a list of issues to select.

    References are not just references to other issues, but references
    to files or dates or anything.
    A nice autocomplete for ditz identifiers, filenames, dates, etc
    could be created for this field in the GUI.

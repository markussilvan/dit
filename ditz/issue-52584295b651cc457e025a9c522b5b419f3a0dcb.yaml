title: Adding a reference to an another issue
desc: |-
  This should be easy, or even automated, when certain strings appear in
  description or comments of the issue.
  Of course the simple way to implement this is just to add a menu option
  to "add reference" which shows a list of issues to select.

    References are not just references to other issues, but references
    to files or dates or anything.
    A nice autocomplete for ditz identifiers, filenames, dates, etc
    could be created for this field in the GUI.

    Done. This was easy to implement and was needed
    for the existing (not very well designed add issue -dialog).

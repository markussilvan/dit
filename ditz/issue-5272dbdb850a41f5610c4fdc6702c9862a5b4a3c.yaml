title: Create cache of issues directly from yaml files
desc: |-
  Currently list of issues is generated by Ditz which
  reads all yaml files to generate a list of issues
  and "issue names". Issue names can only be generated
  if all open issues (at least titles) are cached in memory.
  Create a function do to this first scan.
  
  Use the created cache as base to create names for issues.
  Make functions to convert betweeen name and SHA-1
  identifier using the cache.
  
  Then other operations can be done directly with
  files when the SHA-1 of the file is known.

    A test script to help developing this is started.
    The script should use YamlControl and other *Control
    classes directly. Then the functionality is
    easy take into use in the program when finished.
    
    Developing this way would also automatically
    create an API that is easy to unit test.
    
    Yet I don't think it makes sense to write the
    test script in the form of a unit test directly as
    it would require a lot more work.

    There could be a separate option for initial scan.
    Only titles would be cached to memory and
    "identifying names" generated for the issues.

title: Create cache of issues directly from yaml files
desc: |-
  Currently list of issues is generated by Ditz which
  reads all yaml files to generate a list of issues
  and "issue names". Issue names can only be generated
  if all open issues (at least titles) are cached in memory.
  Create a function do to this first scan.
  
  Use the created cache as base to create names for issues.
  Make functions to convert betweeen name and SHA-1
  identifier using the cache.
  
  Then other operations can be done directly with
  files when the SHA-1 of the file is known.

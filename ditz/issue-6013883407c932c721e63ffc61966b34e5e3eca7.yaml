  Value of remember window size -settings is not shown
  correctly on the settings form. It is used and saved
  correctly, but when the settings form is created the
  value is not loaded. It's always assumed to be false.

    Ok. Now this works.
    While fixing this, it was also noted that window size
    is stored incorrectly (including the frame size) to settings.
    This was also fixed.

title: Application doesn't start without .ditz-gui-config
desc: |-
  If .ditz-gui-config is not found, applications shows an
  ugly error and fails to start.
  This has to be fixed.
  Instead, the program should start with default values.
  If settings are changed, then the configuration file is
  written.

  If .ditz-gui-config is not found, applications shows an
  ugly error and fails to start.
  This has to be fixed.
  Instead, the program should start with default values.
  If settings are changed, then the configuration file is
  written.

    While at it, check that application starts without any
    config files. Check that error cases are handled at
    least half decently. Option to initialize ditz and/or
    re-create project files are handled in a separate issue.

    Ok. Works somewhat decently now.
    Initializing a new project is not possible yet, but
    will be implemented later.

title: Use of the lazy generator in ditz-gui
desc: |-
  Take more advantage of the existing lazy generator
  in ditz-gui.py. The generator can be used for all
  iteration of QListWidgetDitzItems items.
  Also the generator can be made a private method, so
  add an underscore to its name while at it.

    I expect this to be an easy task.
    Has to be done anyway, so why not now.

    Currently that QListWidget is not iterated anywhere
    in the code. The generator is useless unless some
    new functionality requires it.
    One such feature might be implementation of alignments
    based on actual column widths instead of hardcoded
    values.

    Lazy generator wasn't used anywhere anymore. Good.
    So I removed it completely.

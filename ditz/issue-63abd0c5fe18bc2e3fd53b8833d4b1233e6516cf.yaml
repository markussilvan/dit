title: Remove hardcoded paths to icons
desc: |-
  Paths to icons are hardcoded in the Python source.
  At least those paths should be relative to the
  installation folder of ditz-gui, when it's installed
  from a Debian package to the system.
  
  Hopefully this is clarified when first version of
  the Debian packaging is made.
  Use a resource file if that makes any sense.

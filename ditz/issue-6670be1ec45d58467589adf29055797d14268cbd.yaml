title: History browser for archived releases
desc: |-
  If yaml readers are implemented at this point,
  then a separate browser for archived items could
  be made. Better still, the main view could be populated
  with archived items when selected.
  
  Having this feature would be the first step to
  having Ditz completely reimplemented within
  ditz-gui. Implementing other actions to write
  the same files would be just as easy.

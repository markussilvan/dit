    This used to be a simple task, but not so simple anymore.
    Implementing this without Ditz commandline tools is a bit
    more complicated. Anyway, now is the time to implement
    it.

    This can wait until reading releases works.
    Showing release information in main view is in the works.

    Time to continue with this now as
    reading release information works
    all information is cached in ItemCache.

    First thing to do is to create ReleaseDialog
    for adding and editing information of one release.

    A skeleton of ReleaseDialog has been created.
    Now take the dialog to use and/or write code
    to add and edit releases info in project.xml.

    Sketch implementations for reading and writing a release
    now exist. Next the ReleaseDialog should be taken to use
    (so these can be tested). Implement actions to add/edit
    a release.

    ReleaseDialog is now in use. Reading releases works.
    Saving releases should work, but has not been tested.
    Adding a new release and changing an existing release
    need to be tested separately.
    If these are ok, then only adding (automatic) comments
    is missing from the process. Same code could be used
    as is used with issues, but that might require some
    refactoring.

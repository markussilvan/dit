title: Stopping work on an issue
desc: |-
  Just like starting work on an issue, there needs to be a way
  to stop working. The main view with the list of issue is the right
  place to do this.
  
  1. Select issue from a list
  2. Select Stop working from the context-menu, pull-down menu
     or a button
  3. Dialog to verify? I don't think it's needed or should
     be configurable.

  - changed status from unstarted to in_progress
  - If starting work on an issue now works from the UI, then next thing to implement is stopping working.

title: Renaming issues with no component name
desc: |-
  How should this work?
  I expect these should use component name "issue" with
  a running index ''starting from one''.
  Instead it seems index is not reset and they just continue
  onwards from the index left behind from previous component.
  
  Unittest for testRenamingIssues() shows this behaviour.

title: Improve DitzItem __str__()
desc: |-
  The function is currently very simple and fragile.
  Improve the function to work with partial data also.
  It shouldn't break in any situation, even if mandatory
  data fields are missing.

    Nicer formatting of the event log
    would make the GUI look much
    better.

    Current implementation crashes if any
    property is set to None. It also happens
    to be that None values are very common
    with incomplete items.

    Formatting has been improved already as the content is now read from
    YAML files. It can be further improved using HTML formatting
    capabilities of QTextEdit.

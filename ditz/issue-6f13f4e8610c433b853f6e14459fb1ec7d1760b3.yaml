title: Add a toolbar to main view
desc: |-
  There could be toolbar with icons to do actions like
  add, edit, remove issues, access settings, add release, etc.
  Only the most used item can fit here. Menus are still needed
  for less used features.

    Toolbar was already added (partially as a part of a different task). Looks good, so it's here to stay.
    
    Toolbar is still mostly non-functional. Create/refactor actions that can be used both in context menu and the toolbar together. If this is not possible, at least make them use the
    same implementation (slots).

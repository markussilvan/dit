  Archive is needed to get rid of old
  ticket files for "closed" releases.
  Ditz gets slow really fast when amount of tickets
  is growing. (Ditz-gui doesn't have this problem.)

  Ditz functionality itself is simple. Select a release
  and directory where to archive. But implementation
  is fragile. Path may not exist in advance, it can
  only create one directory, ending slash must be
  given(?), etc

  It seems to copy current project.yaml and move all issues
  of the archived release to a given directory. Check that this
  is what it really does.

  Write some sort of implementation for this
  that preferably recognizes errors.
  Also would be nice if the changed files
  could be automatically added to git index
  (if such settings is enabled from settings),
  but that is an another task.

    This is also useful and should be implemented.
    Maybe even before git functionality.

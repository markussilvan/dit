title: Test pitz
desc: |-
  Is it ready and usable? Is the maintainer still active?
  That is pretty much Ditz made in python, so it would
  be easier for me to participate in development.
  
  Maybe Support for pitz could be added to the GUI with
  just adding PitzControl? And adding some flexibility to UI?

    I wasn't even able to run it when I downloaded
    the sources from git.
    At the moment going towards my own solution
    seems a better idea.

    Currently archiving action is enabled for all releases.
    It should be only available for released releases.
    And for that to be usable, there must be way to set
    released releases visible.

    Double check GUI code implementation for archiving now
    as implementation and functionality of archiving has
    slightly changed. For example, destination directories are
    created by the archiving component itself.

title: Writing project.yaml file
desc: |-
  Currently project.xml file is written incorrectly.
  File looks completely different from what is was originally.
  All ditz "datatypes" are missing and everything is written
  as common datatypes (lists, dicts, strings).
  This has to be fixed soon.

    This was fairly easy to do the same way as other
    yaml reads and writes.

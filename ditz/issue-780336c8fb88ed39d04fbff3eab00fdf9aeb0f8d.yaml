  Adding clickable links to other issues in issue titles, descriptions and comments. This also allows to
  create bigger tasks, that list the smaller parts.
  Just like Jira uses "story" and "epic".
  Much cleaner when you can do it with just tasks,
  that contain other tasks. Of course the type of
  that doesn't have to be a 'task' or 'feature'. It
  could be 'epic', if someone wants to use that
  terminology.

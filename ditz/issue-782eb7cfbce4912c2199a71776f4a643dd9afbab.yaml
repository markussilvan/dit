  If Ditz support is dropped then this is back on the table.
  Text in tickets could be input in Markdown format and
  GUI client could show it properly formatted. Still
  CLI client would be totally usable (and able to input
  same information).

  Text -> Markdown conversion in showing a ticket
  should not be a big deal either. See if ready
  components exist for this, or how big of a deal
  would it be to write my own parser for Markdown.

    One python example of Markdown rendering is Grip.
    See https://github.com/joeyespo/grip/tree/master/grip for source.

    import markdown

    Usign Python-Markdown seems very simple.
    import markdown
    html = markdown.markdown(issue_text_string)
    Some configuration to turn on/off some features might
    be in order also. Even supporting Markdown Extra
    would be possible with the library.

    I made a simple Markdown test in playground.
    Seems it would be fairly easy to implement this in ditz-gui.
    When using it, also validate any input first with "bleach"
    library. This is also included in playground examples.

    This should be investigated further. If using Markdown doesn't
    create any issues with YAML files, this should implemented
    soon.

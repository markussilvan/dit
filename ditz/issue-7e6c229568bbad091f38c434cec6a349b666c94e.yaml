  An issue has a numbered list of references.
  Current issue form uses only one line to input
  references. Update the form to use some nice
  widget which supports multiple text items.
  QListWidget or something simpler?
  A separate form?

    Not so interesting, but this just has to be done sometime.
    No new functionality needed. Only GUI changes, but may
    require a alot of those. Should only affect adding and
    editing issues.

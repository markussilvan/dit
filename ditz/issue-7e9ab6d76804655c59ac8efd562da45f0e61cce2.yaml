title: Show icons in context menus
desc: |-
  Currently icons from actions don't
  show up in the context menu.
  This might be happening just because of
  some property on QMenu or QAction.
  
  Search online for a possible solution and
  go through all properties on these two
  classes. Also check if context menu requires
  different size of images or something else.

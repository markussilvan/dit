title: Experiment using Qt Designer for creating GUI windows
desc: |-
  In the beginning of the project, when UI is changing rapidly, it can
  be seen easily if Qt Creator is flexible enough for changing the UI and
  UI related code simultaneously.
  
  Adding an GUI element after functionality has been already written for
  other components on the window is a good test. Also writing custom
  widgets and adding them to UI using the tool would be one case.
  
  Is it easy to import .ui directly in Python or are there many steps
  which would slow down development? Having extra steps would be a hassle
  with a language where you don't even need a compiler to test your changes.

    Main window is working fine. Now a comment dialog is created, let see
    how it works out.

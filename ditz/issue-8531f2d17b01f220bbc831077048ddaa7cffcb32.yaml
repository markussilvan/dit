title: Implement unit tests
desc: |-
  Not much tests exist.
  Implement unit tests where those can be easily
  added and code base can be expected to remain stable.
  When implementing new features without access to
  graphical console, test driven development is preferred.

    Modify run_tests.sh to dynamically run tests
    for all test_*.py files (intead of a hardcoded list of files).
    Even better if this could be done in Python and a
    "master" test suite was created dynamically in the same way.
    But that would be much harder to implement and a little fragile.

title: Cache config settings to memory
desc: |-
  Currently config file is read every time some
  information is asked from ConfigControl.
  Cache all settings to memory, so config file
  only needs to be read once. Then timestamp
  can be checked, if the file needs to be read
  again.

    Done. Project file reading is still missing
    this, but it will be reimplemented anyway.

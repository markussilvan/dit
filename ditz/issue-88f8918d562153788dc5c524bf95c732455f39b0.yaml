component: ditz-gui
creation_time: 2014-10-17 07:01:56.621805 Z
desc: |-
  Implementation of ditz-gui should not
  have anything operating system specific.
  Thus it should work on Windows as is.
  Try if it works, and make assesment for
  needed fixes if it doesn't.

    Better do this sooner than later to
    identify possible issues between platforms
    and to avoid them in the future.

    "Exception, e"  -> "Exception as e" is one change
    that should be done anyway.

    That issue with exceptions is now fixed. Next problem
    encountered is that find_file_along_path() doesn't
    seem to work on Windows.

    So find_file_along_path() loops forever if config is not found.
    File system barrier doesn't stop the loop on Windows.

    Next problem is human_time_diff(), which raises an
    exception for some unknown reason.

  - With python 2.7, everything seems to work on Windows :)

    If .ditz-config is not found, it creates an endless loop
    even with Python 2.7 (on Windows only).

    After fixing find_file_along_path() issue test also placing
    the application and/or ditz repository in a directory which
    has spaces in its name.

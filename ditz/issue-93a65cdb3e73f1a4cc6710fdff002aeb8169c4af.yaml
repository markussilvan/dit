title: YAML output always in same order
desc: |-
  Printing fields in .yaml files in the same
  order will recude the amount of changes from
  git's point of view. This will make cleaner
  patches that are easier to merge.
  
  This must be implemented at some point.
  Luckily the functionality is encapsulated
  in one place and doesn't affect rest of the
  software.

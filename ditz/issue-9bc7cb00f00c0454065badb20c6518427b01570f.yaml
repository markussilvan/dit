title: Refactor release event log handling
desc: |-
  Automatic comments to release event log
  should be added from within config.
  This removes the dependency from UI and
  and makes it work the same way even if
  a release is created using other means
  (like scripts, console ui).
  The comment requested from user should
  come as parameter to these commands.
  This way dependency to UI in config
  is avoided.

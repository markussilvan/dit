title: Implement actions for menus
desc: |-
  Implement actions for the common menu options.
  Quit is the first example to test how it works along with Qt Creator.
  Reload is good for testing how DitzControl is coming along.
  It can be the first place to test reading ditz data to the UI.

    Adding some actions early will show how code and Qt Creator .ui files
    work together.

  - Just do this from the code as it seems impossible to do from Qt Creator.

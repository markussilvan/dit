title: Read Ditz mailing list and Ditz 0.6 status
desc: |-
  Ditz mailing list was mentioned in some news article.
  Find it and read it. Is it still active?
  Is someone still maintaining the project?
  Are there forks? What is the Ditz 0.6 which is
  not from the original developer?

    Seems 0.6 version has been under works, but hasn't been released.
    Last activity is from summer 2013. Let's see if there will be more
    activity if a submit some patches or show them Ditz GUI.

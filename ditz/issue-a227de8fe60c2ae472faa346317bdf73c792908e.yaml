  I don't know any reason why Python 3 could not be used.
  I assume all required libraries also support Python 3 these days.
  Port the software to python 3.

  Easier to do it sooner than later.

    This task has been started.
    At least adding tasks and commenting now works.
    All functionality still needs to be tested (and fixed).
    Shebangs in the files should be updated.

    Unittest still run on Python 2. If that starts to cause problems,
    a way to update them to Python 3 needs to be figured out.

    Looking at the code, this should be fine.
    All functionality hasn't been tested, but problems will not be hard to find, if something shows up.

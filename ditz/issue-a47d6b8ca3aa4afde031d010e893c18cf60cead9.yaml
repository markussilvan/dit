title: DitzItem <-> IssueYamlObject type conversions
desc: |-
  Editing issues requires these type conversions
  for convenience. Reading and writing .yaml files
  can be then encapsulated more effectively.

    This is mostly done, but there are some inconsistencies.
      - Component is missing from DitzItem
      - Creation_time is missing from DitzItem (uses "ago" string instead)
      - Order of items is different, but this doesn't matter, at least for now
      - References should stored as list of strings(?)
    
    Could I even go as far as using some sort of derived type of IssueYamlObject?
    Turning DitzItem into a hierarchy of objects? Releases could have their own
    ReleaseYamlObject?
    
    Think and try different solutions.

    Custom implementation for showing textual time
    differences done. Now use it to show "ago".

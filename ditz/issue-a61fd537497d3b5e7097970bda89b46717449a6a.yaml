title: Adding images to issues
desc: |-
  Linking images or diagrams to issues should
  be done in a way that maintains compatibility
  with Ditz commandline tool.
  If such link is found from the issue text
  and such graphics file from issue_dir/issue-<hash>/ directory,
  then it could be shown on the GUI.

    Adding images could be done using Markdown syntax.
    Actually whole Markdown syntex could be supported.
    That would also allow refering to tickets and files,
    writing titles, list and other text formatting.
    Of course Ditz-gui could show all that as formatted
    text. Libraries exist for Python to do that.

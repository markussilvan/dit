    Parsing works now. Fine tune the output format.
    Test with something that has multiple references.
    Add line breaks to DitzItem output, when printing
    references?

  - After testing with multiple references this issue can be closed.

    This also seems to work now. Time to return to this
    when support for plugins is needed, or some changes
    are required because the edit dialog.

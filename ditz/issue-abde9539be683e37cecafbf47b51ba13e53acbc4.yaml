    Currently will show all releases, also the released ones.
    An option to only show unreleased releases is needed.

    If Ditz can't reliably order releases then, optional ordering
    for release names could be used here too.

    A yaml reading solution for this exists.
    Maybe I should use that, just for kicks.
    Dependency to python-yaml will come
    eventually anyway.

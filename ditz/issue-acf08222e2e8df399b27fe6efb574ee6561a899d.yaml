  As CommentDialog is used in multiple contexts, it could
  have a customizable window title. The title could be given
  as parameter when the dialog is created. This would
  allow showing titles like "Close issue - Comment"
  instead of just "Comment". The user would see what
  action was selected for the item.
  The selected item is visible on the list on the
  main window.

title: Don't allow making a release with open issues
desc: |-
  Don't allow making a release if it contains open
  issues. Alternatively a dialog could ask what
  should be done with the renaming issues.
  Those could be set as 'Unassigned' or assigned
  to a given release.

    Not allowing a release if it contains tasks
    is simple to implement. A separate task
    has been created for those other options.
    Those can be implemented later when more
    burning issues have been handled first.

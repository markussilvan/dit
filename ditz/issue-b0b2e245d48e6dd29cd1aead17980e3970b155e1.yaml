title: Parsing issues should be able to parse component information
desc: |-
  If components are used in the project, adding and reading
  issues should be able to act accordingly.
  This requires additional steps to both processes.
  How to get information if project is using components?
  Can you use some "ditz components" output for that or
  does it require reading the project.yaml file?

title: Text alignment in list of Ditz items
desc: |-
  The list of Ditz items in listWidgetDitzItems is now fine
  except for one detail. When the ditz_name/ditz_id field
  length changes, the headers of those items are not
  aligned. This happens if there are multiple components
  or if more digits are added to ditz names.
  For example "{issue cd68c54f4f3a215ec7eee0828c19d32719a86616}" vs. "{issue cbff37e95538779ff3dc05e883a62e7627a1a121}".
  
  If the listWidget doesn't provide a way to align those
  fields, I could derive my own, set the texts with
  padding or using tableWidget instead.
  Changing to tableWidget might be a big hassle, so
  padding options should be considered first as a
  quick fix.

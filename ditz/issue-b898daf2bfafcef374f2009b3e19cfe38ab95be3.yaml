  Changing order of releases is not supported by Ditz.
  It can be implemented by modifying the content of
  project.yaml and changing the order of releases there.

  In the GUI this should be done on the Releases-dialog
  where you can select a release, then use up/down -arrows
  to move it.

    This is more common then I originally expected. New releases
    added between releases that were planned in the beginning
    could be coming all the time.

    Some mechanism for ordering the releases needs to
    be created. (This shouldn't affect Ditz.)
    Hopefully an extra index field in the file can be used.
    If not, then ordering by name or creation date might
    be an option.

    This feature is has higher priority as it affect what the
    main list view looks like.

    Releases are in a list. Just changing the order of that list
    is all it takes. The UI part is more tricky.
    Maybe 'move up' and 'move down' -buttons would
    be enough?

    Also when adding a release, there could be an
    option to select another release that precedes
    this new release. Thus setting the order.

    Implement the functionality with a test script.
    If that seems good, draw Up/Down -icons.
    Then put the two together in GUI.

title: Reordering releases
desc: |-
  Changing order of releases is not supported by Ditz.
  It can be implemented by modifying the content of
  project.yaml and changing the order of releases there.
  
  In the GUI this should be done on the Releases-dialog
  where you can select a release, then use up/down -arrows
  to move it.

    This is more common then I originally expected. New releases
    added between releases that were planned in the beginning
    could be coming all the time.

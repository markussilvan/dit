  Icon for opening settings is hideous. Try a blue wrench instead.

  The icon of commenting a release is good, but contrast between "speech bubble" and release symbol is too big.
  Smooth it out.

    These could be done at the same time as
    adding new icon for archiving releases.
    Doing all at once reduces overhead.

    Release symbols should be similar to issue symbols.
    So, making a release should have the same tick mark as finishing a task. Same goes with removing a task or a release.

  - The current symbol for making a release could be used for "Archive a release".

title: Automatically _adding_ changes to git
desc: |-
  If Ditz is used like I am used to using it. Then one good
  feature would be to add changes to git index automatically.
  User doesn't want to do that manually when using a GUI.
  
  Or there could be a toolbar button to "upload" changes to git.
  That would stash other changes, add and commit all ditz items,
  then pop changes back. But that is an another issue and a
  different mode of using the software.

  If ditz-gui is started in a directory (tree) which

  if he wants to initialize a new Ditz repo here.

    It should be also noted, that ditz doesn't work,
    if it's not initialized. Thus the program should
    check at startup that config file is found.
    If not, it could show a warning and open settings automatically.

    Implement this using custom .ditzconfig yaml writer.
    Create issue directory from python after "initialization".
    Don't actually rely on "ditz init".

    All this requires is ability to write the .ditzconfig
    file, the project.yaml file and the directory for issues.

    Software is already capable of writing the .ditzconfig
    file. Now it just needs to know what to do in a situation
    that the config file is not found.

    ...and the software is already capable of writing the
    project.xml.

    A simple Yes/No -dialog would suffice for now.
    "Ditz project not found. Would you like to initialize a new project here?"

title: Add a config setting for showing closed issues
desc: |-
  Original Ditz is not able to show closed issues.
  Add a config option to show closed issues in the main listview.
  Functionality to provide this information from DitzControl to
  GUI already exists.
  GUI might need minor changes for this, but this could be
  a useful feature.
  
  Only open releases can be listed. Archived releases are
  out of reach by this feature.
  If archive need to be browsed, that is a completely different
  feature that should be implemented much later, when more
  important things are already finished.

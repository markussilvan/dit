  Currently all text is just concatenated.
  Change it to "change chapter" when an empty line is
  encountered between text.

  Like this. A new block.

    I'll try how this works out.
    Also it should be kept in mind that
    other kind of text formatting might be needed
    in the future. Adding more of these should be easy.

    Ok. Having text split in multiple paragraphs works well now.

    Looks nice. If I come with other text formattings to do, then
    just add them.

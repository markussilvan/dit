title: Implement CLI interface
desc: |-
  To drop Ditz dependency completely, implement
  custom command line interface. It should be
  similar to what ditz has.
  Implementation should be fairly easy, and
  stuff from playground can be used to get
  started.

    Then the system can be renamed to tIssue, if
    there is no Ditz dependence or compatibility
    anymore.

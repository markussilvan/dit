title: Show a "Closed"-stamp
desc: |-
  Show a "Closed"-stamp on the issue text view when the issue has been closed,
  but the text is still on the view. This gives a nice impression, and
  also turns a current unwanted feature of showing the text into a wanted
  feature.

  - When implementing this think also about the possibility of showin a dropped stamp for dropped items. Or a nice green stamp for completed tasks.

title: Fix data formatting in project file writing
desc: |-
  Project file data fields should be
  written the same way as issue data fields.
  Currently format of timestamps and multiline
  strings (at least) is different from format
  produced by Ditz.
  Implementation to fix this already exists in
  issue writing. Copy it or make a more general
  implementation.

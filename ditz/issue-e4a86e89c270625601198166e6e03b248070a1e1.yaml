title: Fix data formatting in project file writing
desc: |-
  Project file data fields should be
  written the same way as issue data fields.
  Currently format of timestamps and multiline
  strings (at least) is different from format
  produced by Ditz.
  Implementation to fix this already exists in
  issue writing. Copy it or make a more general
  implementation.

    Don't duplicate the same code. Instead try to
    figure out a common place for the initialization
    code which sets those constructors and representers
    for datetime and unicode string classes.
    Now it's done in IssueModel, but it should be
    moved to somewhere "reachable" by all Model classes.

    It happens because writing the issue file causes "relelease: "
    to be changed to "release: ''".
    Something fails when reading the release as an empty string.
    Could be it is not just interpreted correctly as unassigned.

    Find the root cause and make a fix.

    That was a real existing bug, and now it's fixed.
    It  wasn't caused by migration to Python 3 or PyQt5.

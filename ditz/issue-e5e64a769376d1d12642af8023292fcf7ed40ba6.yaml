  Instead of add/edit/remove buttons, use buttons
  which only have icons. Use similar blue theme
  that is used on the main window. A plus,
  a minus and a pen. Maybe even the same
  icons could be used? Or make square
  versions of the same icons?

    Icons look good to me, but maybe some different kind
    of button (QToolButton) would look better?
    Doesn't really matter at this point.

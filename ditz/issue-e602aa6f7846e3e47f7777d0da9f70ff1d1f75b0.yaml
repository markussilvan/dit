title: Make font configurable
desc: |-
  Settings view should have a tab for setting
  list view settings, font settings or something
  similar. Changing the font and font size are
  the most important settings (so everyone can
  select a nice monospaced font).
  
  Hopefully some of these settings can be made even
  project dependent using ditz-gui config file.
  Then there could be global config separately,
  if necessary.

    List view alignment doesn't need configuration.
    Width of each field can be optimally calculated from
    the content of those fields. Turns out that is
    very easy in Python.

  - assigned to release v0.2.1 from v0.2
  - This is lower priority than functionality for handling releases.

    List view alignment was made to align automatically
    based on issue name widths.
    Thus this item was now heavy edited to focus on
    font configuration only.

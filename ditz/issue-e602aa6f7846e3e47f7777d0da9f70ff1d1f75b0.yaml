  Settings view should have a tab for setting
  list view properties. Most important settings are
  the font (so everyone can select a nice monospaced font),
  and the alingment of fields in the list.
  The perfect alignment depends on the font and
  the project being worked on.

  Hopefully some of these settings can be made even
  project dependent using save config files
  as Ditz. Then there could be global alignment
  and project specified alignment, if necessary.

    List view alignment doesn't need configuration.
    Width of each field can be optimally calculated from
    the content of those fields. Turns out that is
    very easy in Python.

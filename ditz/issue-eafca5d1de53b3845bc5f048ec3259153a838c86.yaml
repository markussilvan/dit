title: Showing project overall status
desc: |-
  A main view footer or a separate dialog could show an overall
  status of the project. How many issues are assigned to each release
  and how many of them are open or done. How many bugs there are.
  (See "ditz status").
  
  Main view is quickly becoming too crowded, and it looks better
  when it's simple. So think a separate dialog is better.

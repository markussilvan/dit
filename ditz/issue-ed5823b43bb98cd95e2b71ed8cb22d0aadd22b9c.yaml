  Move ui code under src/ui.
  Move all control classes under src/control.
  Make required changes to source file import statements.
  This makes sense as the software gets bigger.

    Also think about renaming some files.
    For example, configcontrol.py contains
    ConfigControl and DitzSettings classes.
    This file should be renamed to settings.py.
    ConfigControl could be renamed to SettingsControl?

    Or alternatively rename DitzSettings to DitzConfig.
    Using Config and Settings for the same purpose is ambiguous.

    I still don't have a clear idea how the files should
    be  divided. Currect setup is fine so far.
    Lets look at this later.

title: Main window
desc: |-
  The main window should show a list of ditz issue read from issue files
  or directly from the ditz command line tool output.
  The list items need to be selectable, so they can be viewed, edited, etc.
  
  Maybe the main view should also show the content of the selected issue.
  This is to be decided later, but now it seems like a good idea.

    I don't even know which Qt component to use for the main view
    yet. Needs some experimenting.
    Check what was used in Portfolio Manager. Maybe I should use the
    same component (or some newer component that didn't exist back then).

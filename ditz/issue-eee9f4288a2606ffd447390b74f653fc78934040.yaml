  The main window should show a list of ditz issue read from issue files
  or directly from the ditz command line tool output.
  The list items need to be selectable, so they can be viewed, edited, etc.
  
  Maybe the main view should also show the content of the selected issue.
  This is to be decided later, but now it seems like a good idea.

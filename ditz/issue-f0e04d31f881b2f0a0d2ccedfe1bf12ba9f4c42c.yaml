title: Parsing name or id of a new item from output
desc: |-
  When a new item is added its name or identifier is not
  available. It is only available after reload.
  But then it's impossible to find the item anymore as
  only identifying data is the identifier.
  
  Parse the name or id from "ditz add" command's output.
  Then it can be used instantly, if needed.

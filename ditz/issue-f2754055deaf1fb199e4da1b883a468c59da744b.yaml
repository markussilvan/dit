title: A config file
desc: |-
  Can I share the config file with Ditz on the project level?
  Add user settings to ~/.ditz-gui/config or something similar.
  What is the most useful format? Is there a common parser?

    As I understand the workings of these .yaml files, it could
    be just fine to put own configs to the same file as Ditz does.
    Global configs could be in a separate file in the users home
    directory.

    Configs can't be added to Ditz config file.
    Ditz will give a warning about those.
    Instead a .ditz-gui-config has been created.
    That file should be moved to user's home
    directory, but make sure it works on Linux
    and Windows. If not easily possible, leave
    it at project root directory.

    Can be done in a separate dialog, but can the same dialog, widget or
    something be used in the main window when browsing items.
    (Just thinking ahead for the future versions.)

    Work on this has been started. The form exists. Now
    improve ways to handle Ditz data. Do this hand in hand
    with reading and parsing Ditz data to a object and filling
    such object from the Add Issue -form.
    
    Just extend DitzItem to (optionally) contain all item data or
    derive a new subclass to do that.

    At least adding new issues on DitzControl level now works.
    Also the GUI dialogs are done.

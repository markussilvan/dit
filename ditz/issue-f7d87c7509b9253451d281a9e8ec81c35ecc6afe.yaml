title: Action to add issue directly to a selected release
desc: |-
  If a release is selected from the main list view,
  there could be an option to add a new issue directly
  to that release. There also is an option to add a new
  issue already. If that is done when a release it selected,
  it could do this without any extra hassle.
  Then the current release would be selected by default
  on the IssueDialog when adding a new issue.

    I prefer the latter option. It's actually feasible.
    The first option seems stupid.

    This whole ticket is starting to feel stupid.
    I suggest this won't be implemented.

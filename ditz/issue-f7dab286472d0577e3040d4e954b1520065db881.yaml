title: Make Ditz windows remember their size
desc: |-
  Users have different preferences and different sizes of displays and fonts.
  Ditz-gui windows should also adapt to that. As they do.
  But the windows should also remember their size, so user doesn't always
  need to adjust it when starting ditz-gui.

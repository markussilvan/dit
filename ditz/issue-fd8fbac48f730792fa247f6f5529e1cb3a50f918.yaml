  Currently releases can be unreleased/released.
  Add support for cancelling releases.
  This differs from removing a release a bit
  as the release information is still stored
  in the system.

    This of course requires that it is possible to see
    released releases. That is not possible in Ditz.
    Can be easily implemented on ditz-gui.

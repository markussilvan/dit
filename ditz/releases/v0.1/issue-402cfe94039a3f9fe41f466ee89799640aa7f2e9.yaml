title: Support for selecting release on add dialog
desc: |-
  Currently release option is hardcoded

  issues. Fix that to get the actual release
  "number" from somewhere.

    Ok, this works now.
    Some testing is still needed to make sure the indices
    and command line selections don't get mixed in any situation.

title: Rename fields in DitzItem and code in general
desc: |-
  Start using same naming as is used in Ditz.
  Instead of header, use title. Ditz_id should be ditz_name
  unless it means either is accepted (name or identifier).
  
  This is a minor task to replace the names in all files.
  UI code already uses correct naming, so no changes there.

  - Done. Item type and issue type are good enough. Other fields don't have item_ prefix anymore. It makes the code a bit cleaner.
